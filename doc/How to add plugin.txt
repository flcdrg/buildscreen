* To add a plugin to BuildScreen you have to implement IBuildScreenPlugin found in BuildScreen.Plugin.dll. And your implementation also needs to derive from 'MarshalByRefObject'.
* Next thing is to add your dll to folder 'Plugin'
* When this is done you need to configure the plugin in 'BuildScreen.exe.config'
* Add the following under <Plugins>
	-  <plugin type="Namespace.ClassName" name="NameOfDll.dll" />

When this is done. Your plugin should be triggered every time a build changes status (Success/fail). You can look in your EventViewer to see logs.
